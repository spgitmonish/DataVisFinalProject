# DataVisFinalProject
After a lot of contemplation I finally decided on visualizing student debt.
Using data I found on the website http://college-insight.org/, I created a map
of the US states, with each states colored in a different shade of red to show
average debt and a "bubble" to indicate the percentage of students in debt.
